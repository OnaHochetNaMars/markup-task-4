<h3>How the wiz&shy;ard&shy;ing world works</h3>
<h4>WAND CORE</h4>
<div><p class="firstParagraph">
The fol&shy;low&shy;ing de&shy;scrip&shy;tion of the powers and prop&shy;er&shy;ties of the three main wand cores used by Mr Gar&shy;rick Ol&shy;li&shy;vander are taken from his own notes.
</p></div>
<div>
<blockquote>
Early in my ca&shy;reer, as I watched my wand&shy;maker fath&shy;er wrest&shy;ling with sub&shy;stand&shy;ard wand core ma&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;als such as kel&shy;pie hair, I con&shy;ceived the am&shy;bi&shy;tion to dis&shy;cov&shy;er the finest cores and to work only with those when my time came to take over the fam&shy;ily busi&shy;ness. This I have done. After much ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;a&shy;tion and re&shy;search, I con&shy;cluded that only three sub&shy;stances pro&shy;duce wands of the qual&shy;ity to which I am happy to give the il&shy;lus&shy;tri&shy;ous name of Ol&shy;li&shy;vander: uni&shy;corn hair, dragon heart&shy;string and phoenix feath&shy;er. Each of these costly and rare ma&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;als has its own dis&shy;tinct prop&shy;er&shy;ties. The fol&shy;low&shy;ing rep&shy;res&shy;ents a short sum&shy;mary of my re&shy;searches in&shy;to each of the three Su&shy;preme Cores. Read&shy;ers should bear in mind that each wand is the com&shy;pos&shy;ite of its wood, its core and the ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence and nature of its own&shy;er; that tend&shy;en&shy;cies of each may coun&shy;ter&shy;bal&shy;ance or out&shy;weigh the oth&shy;er; so this can only be a very gen&shy;er&shy;al over&shy;view of an im&shy;mensely com&shy;plex sub&shy;ject.
</blockquote></div>
<div><p>
Uni&shy;corn
</p></div>
<div><p>
Uni&shy;corn hair gen&shy;er&shy;ally pro&shy;duces the most con&shy;sist&shy;ent ma&shy;gic, and is least sub&shy;ject to fluc&shy;tu&shy;ations and block&shy;ages. Wands with uni&shy;corn cores are gen&shy;er&shy;ally the most dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faith&shy;ful of all wands, and usu&shy;ally re&shy;main strongly at&shy;tached to their first own&shy;er, ir&shy;re&shy;spect&shy;ive of wheth&shy;er he or she was an ac&shy;com&shy;plished witch or wiz&shy;ard.
</p></div>

<figcaption>Example of Wand Core</figcaption>
</figure>
<div><p>
Minor dis&shy;ad&shy;vant&shy;ages of uni&shy;corn hair are that they do not make the most power&shy;ful wands (al&shy;though the wand wood may com&shy;pensate) and that they are prone to mel&shy;an&shy;choly if ser&shy;i&shy;ously mis&shy;handled, mean&shy;ing that the hair may 'die' and need re&shy;pla&shy;cing.
</p></div>
<div><p>
Dragon
</p></div>
<div><p>
As a rule, dragon heartstrings pro&shy;duce wands with the most power, and which are cap&shy;able of the most flam&shy;boy&shy;ant spells. Dragon wands tend to learn more quickly than oth&shy;er types. While they can change al&shy;le&shy;gi&shy;ance if won from their ori&shy;gin&shy;al mas&shy;ter, they al&shy;ways bond strongly with the cur&shy;rent own&shy;er.
</p></div>
<div><p>
The dragon wand tends to be easi&shy;est to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not in&shy;cline that way of its own ac&shy;cord. It is also the most prone of the three cores to ac&shy;ci&shy;dents, be&shy;ing some&shy;what tem&shy;pera&shy;ment&shy;al.
</p></div>
<div><p>
Phoenix
</p></div>
<div><p>
This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feath&shy;ers are cap&shy;able of the greatest range of ma&shy;gic, though they may take longer than either uni&shy;corn or dragon cores to re&shy;veal this. They show the most ini&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ive, some&shy;times act&shy;ing of their own ac&shy;cord, a qual&shy;ity that many witches and wiz&shy;ards dis&shy;like.
</p></div>
<div><p>
Phoenix feath&shy;er wands are al&shy;ways the pick&shy;i&shy;est when it comes to po&shy;ten&shy;tial own&shy;ers, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent and de&shy;tached in the world. These wands are the hard&shy;est to tame and to per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ise, and their al&shy;le&shy;gi&shy;ance is usu&shy;ally hard won.

<h3>Mem&shy;bers of The Or&shy;der of the Phoenix</h3>
<article>
<h4>RE&shy;MUS LUPIN</h4>
<div><p class="firstParagraph">
Re&shy;mus Lupin was the only child of the wiz&shy;ard Ly&shy;all Lupin and his Muggle wife Hope How&shy;ell.
</p></div>
<div><p>
Ly&shy;all Lupin was a very clev&shy;er, rather shy young man who, by the time he was thirty, had be&shy;come a world-renowned au&shy;thor&shy;ity on Non-Hu&shy;man Spir&shy;it&shy;ous Ap&shy;par&shy;i&shy;tions. These in&shy;clude pol&shy;tergeists, Bog&shy;garts and oth&shy;er strange creatures that, while some&shy;times ghost&shy;like in ap&shy;pear&shy;ance and be&shy;ha&shy;viour, have nev&shy;er been truly alive and re&shy;main something of a mys&shy;tery even to the wiz&shy;ard&shy;ing world.
</p></div>
<div><p>
On an in&shy;vest&shy;ig&shy;at&shy;ive trip in&shy;to a dense Welsh forest in which a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly vi&shy;cious Bog&shy;gart was sup&shy;posed to be lurk&shy;ing, Ly&shy;all ran across his fu&shy;ture wife. Hope How&shy;ell, a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful Muggle girl who worked in an in&shy;sur&shy;ance of&shy;fice in Cardiff, had taken an ill-ad&shy;vised walk through what she be&shy;lieved to be in&shy;no&shy;cent wood&shy;land. Bog&shy;garts and pol&shy;tergeists may be sensed by Muggles, and Hope, a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly ima&shy;gin&shy;at&shy;ive and sens&shy;it&shy;ive per&shy;son, had be&shy;come con&shy;vinced that something was watch&shy;ing her from between the dark trees. Even&shy;tu&shy;ally, her ima&shy;gin&shy;a&shy;tion be&shy;came so over&shy;act&shy;ive that the Bog&shy;gart as&shy;sumed a form: that of a large, evil-look&shy;ing man, bear&shy;ing down on her with a snarl and out&shy;stretched hands in the gloom. 
</p></div>

<div><p>
Hear&shy;ing her scream, young Ly&shy;all came sprint&shy;ing through the trees, caus&shy;ing the ap&shy;par&shy;i&shy;tion to shrink in&shy;to a field mush&shy;room with one wave of his wand. The ter&shy;ri&shy;fied Hope thought, in her con&shy;fu&shy;sion, that he had driv&shy;en her would-be at&shy;tack&shy;er away, and his first words to her – ‘it’s all right, it was only a Bog&shy;gart’ – made no im&shy;pres&shy;sion on her. No&shy;ti&shy;cing how very beau&shy;ti&shy;ful she was, Ly&shy;all made the wise de&shy;cision not to talk about Bog&shy;garts any more, but in&shy;stead agreed that the man had been very big and scary, and that the only sens&shy;ible thing to do was for him to ac&shy;com&shy;pany Hope home to pro&shy;tect her.
</p></div>
<div><p>
The young couple fell in love, and not even Ly&shy;all’s shame&shy;faced ad&shy;mis&shy;sion, some months later, that Hope had nev&shy;er really been in danger, den&shy;ted her en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;asm for him. To Ly&shy;all’s de&shy;light, Hope ac&shy;cep&shy;ted his pro&shy;pos&shy;al of mar&shy;riage and threw her&shy;self en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;ast&shy;ic&shy;ally in&shy;to pre&shy;par&shy;a&shy;tions for the wed&shy;ding, com&shy;plete with a Bog&shy;gart-topped cake.
</p></div>
<div><p>
Ly&shy;all and Hope’s first and only child, Re&shy;mus John, was born after a year of mar&shy;riage. A happy, healthy little boy, he showed early signs of ma&shy;gic and both par&shy;ents ima&shy;gined that he would fol&shy;low in his fath&shy;er’s foot&shy;steps, at&shy;tend&shy;ing Hog&shy;warts School of Witch&shy;craft and Wiz&shy;ardry in due course.
